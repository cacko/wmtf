Hi Ollie, 
  
  
 we have improved the templates for when incidents by the monitoring team. 
 The templates currently reside on this page - 
 [@click=open_browser('https://sites.google.com/a/travelfusion.com/monitoring-2013/incidents?authuser=0')]https://sites.google.com/a/travelfusion.com/mon...[/] 
  
  
 Can we have the current templates in the drop down menu replaced with he templates on this page. 
  
 with the 5 templates headers being - 
  
 Initial Incident 
 Payment (card rejection etc). 
 Balance issues 
 Site change 
 Suppliers slow, down/instability. 
  
  
 and the subsequent text filled in the template as per the page - [@click=open_browser('https://sites.google.com/a/travelfusion.com/monitoring-2013/incidents?authuser=0')]https://sites.google.com/a/travelfusion.com/mon...[/]
